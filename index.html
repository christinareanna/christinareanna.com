                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello and welcome to my page. I'm 26 years old and reside in Chicago, IL. I lived in Seattle, WA
                        for 5 years and decided to make the move back home.
                        I'm currently in a software engineer immersion program with Thinkful Bootcamp and I'm set to
                        graduate in February 2022!

                    <h2>Passions</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've always been an artist and became very interested in Front-End developmnent at a young age.
                        I taught myself the basics of HTML/CSS before I was 10 years old.
                        I decided to expand my knowledge with back-end programming in 2020. I decided on doing a
                        bootcamp because I enjoy learning at a fast pace. I hope to be a React developer one day since
                        I'm endlessly fascinated with it, but that is subject to change in the future as I continue to
                        learn more! Previously, I was obsessed with photography and was a photographer at different
                        studios in the past.
                        I prefer being able to have the option to create what I want though, so I decided to leave the
                        studios and pursue other passions.

                    <h3>The Trickling Anomaly</h3>
                    <p>I've been a poet since I was about 14.
                        I wrote this when I was at my ex's place.
                        I felt this need to write about how I would
                        feel without him because I knew the inevitable was coming.
                        I decided to call my poetry book "The Trickling Anomaly".
                        It won't be coming out for a while, but it is based around the idea
                        that sometimes things happen in life that you don't expect.
                        It's very much centered around loss, grief, finding happiness,
                        and what happiness even means. This is probably the shortest
                        poem I have written.

                    <h3>Freelance Modeling</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've dabbled into freelance modeling for the past 6 years.
                        I would always prefer to be behind the camera, but putting
                        myself in front of it instead pushed me to be myself more.
                        I'm overly critical of myself, so doing this has been a great
                        reminder to be myself.
